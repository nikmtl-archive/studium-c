   TO DO 1: Think about the expressions: What will be the output of the programm? 
            ...only then remove the last line und compile/run the program. Were your predictions correct?
   TO DO 2: With your neighbour: Exchange difficult expressions with each other
            - can you solve them without running the program?
            - use brackets to structure the expressions without changing their values
